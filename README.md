### Just as quick note : you may see that in some exercises we use some no sense hardcoded code that we can just replace it with a better approach, well that correct, but just to match the authorized list

### Module00
- 0: Simple introduction to print function.
- 1: Introduce the input function also the converting int function which create a new object from the received one.
- 2: Calculation in python.
- 3 & 4: Introduction to conditions.
- 5: Using the builtin range() function.
- 6: Practice syntax.
- 7: More conditional.

**At the module0 there is 7 exercises, each one aim to make you more familiar with the python syntax.**

### Module01
- 0: First using of the condition if __name__ == "__main__" so strict a function to the main script.
- 1: Represent the constructors __new__ , __init__ in classe and creating simple class.
- 2: Get into methods and learn how to print an organized output.
- 3: More practice and improve class usage.
- 4: Implement the setter and getter to protect the important data from external direct changing.
- 5: Introduce you to the inheritance concept and encourage you to use super() function for efficient inheritance.
- 6: Practice inheritance, nested classes several methods types and design.

**The Module exercises was wonderful the assignments was vague but solid, its let you discover the new concepts by clean way, i learned a lot like
inheritance of classes also nested classes, classmethods, staticmethods,
also how to design a small system with a complex component.**

### Module02
- 0: Introduction to the exception and discover how u prevent your program from crashing.
- 1: Playing with different builtin error types.
- 2: Discover the ability to create a custom type error.
- 3: Understand the benefits of using finally statement.
- 4: Practice the raise keyword to raise an builtin or custom error.
- 5: Practice all the previous concepts withing a complex system.

**The Module show the power of Exceptions, that give the ability of preventing your program from crashing, and also how to create your custom exceptions with a clear specific message**

### Module03
- 0: Discover the sys module and the sys.argv list that hold the command line arguments.
- 1: Practice the command line arguments with some builtin functions.
- 2: Practice unpacking and more builtin functions, math module, tuple data collection, exceptions.
- 3: Introduction to 'set' data collection and its methods: union(), intersection(), difference().
- 4: Introduction to 'dict' data collection and its methods: keys(), values(), items(), get(), update().
- 5: A great new concept: 'yield', 'next', iter, and how to create generators to stream data instead of store it.
- 6: Demonstrate List/dict/set comprehensions with a complex gaming system (not really complex).

**The module focus on demonstrating a several new concepts, and some data collections, and also show the magic behind some functions like range() and the generators**

### Module04
- 0: Introduction to open, close, read functions.
- 1: Write method that write certain data to specific file, by its object.
- 2: Discover the tree streams tunnels (sys.stdin, sys.stdout, sys.stderr).
- 3: Usage of 'with' statement and how its protect the data corruption.
- 4: Practice handling file error exceptions and protecting file data.

**The module was a extending of the C knowledge of file handling, opening, reading, writing..., of course with a sugar simplicity which make work with the concept much easier alternative to C**

### Module05
- 0: Introduction of Polymorphism concepts applicable by the abstract way in python by accessing (ABC, abstractmethod), and building an shared interface with different behaviors.
- 1: Practice more abstraction with a little complex scenario.
- 2: Mastering the abstraction and Polymorphism, also additional to Protocol idea, and mix all that with a complex system.

**The Module was great that discover that fantastic concept of the Polymorphism, and help for soliding the fundamental concepts with a complex systems.**

### Module06
- P1: Introduction to the power of packages, and discover the __init__, which the main initializer for a package.
- P2: Discover different pattern of importing.
- P3: The key difference between "Absolute paths" and "Relative paths"
- P4: Take a look of the problem of circular dependencies and try a methods to breaking the circular curse.

**The Module was a quick overview of the packages and the importing concepts in python which is essential for most python projects.**

### Module07
- 0: Another introduction to abstraction with a little game system and also discover the enumeration
- 1: Practicing concreted implementation based on some logic from previous exercise.
- 2: Implement multiple abstract inheritance for shared interfaces.
- 3: Practice combining the Factory and Strategy patterns within a GameEngine to achieve maximum architectural flexibility.
- 4: Advanced Interface Composition use Multiple Inheritance based on preivous actions to build a small robust system
