# Growing Code!

### community garden

## Description

***In this project, you’ll discover Python’s core concepts through community garden scenarios.
You’ll work with practical exercises that introduce fundamental programming concepts in an engaging, real-world context.
Each exercise builds upon the previous one, helping you develop essential programming skills while working on meaningful tasks.***

## Instructions

-Each function code must respect the flake8 linter standards.
-Submit just the function implementation in the file, no need for the main program.




To test the functions, a program ***main.py*** is provided to test the required behavior for each function.
